# Google Blogger Ethereal template - Remastering for SEO

## Introduction

To remaster the Google Blogger Ethereal template and address SEO issues, follow these steps:

1. **Optimize Heading Structure:**
   - Ensure that each page has only one `<h1>` heading, which should ideally be the title of the blog post or page.
   - Use proper heading hierarchy (e.g., `<h2>`, `<h3>`) for subheadings within the content to improve readability and SEO.

2. **Implement Meta Tags:**
   - Include essential meta tags in the `<head>` section of the template for improved SEO.
   - Add meta tags for description, keywords, author, and viewport.
   - Example:

   ```html
     <meta name="description" content="Your blog description here">
     <meta name="keywords" content="keyword1, keyword2, keyword3">
     <meta name="author" content="Your Name">
     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
   ```

3. **Noindex Archive Pages and Search Labels:**
   - Prevent indexing of archive pages and search label pages to avoid duplicate content issues.
   - Insert the following meta tag within the relevant sections of the template:

   ```html
     <meta name="robots" content="noindex">
   ```

4. **Canonical Tags:**
   - Implement canonical tags to specify the preferred version of URLs, especially for duplicate or similar content.
   - Use the following tag within the `<head>` section of each page:

   ```html
     <link rel="canonical" href="https://your-blog-url.com">
   ```

5. **Structured Data Markup:**
   - Add structured data markup using schema.org vocabulary to provide search engines with additional context about your content.
   - Include markup for articles, blog posts, and other relevant content types.
   - Example:

   ```html
     <script type="application/ld+json">
     {
       "@context": "https://schema.org",
       "@type": "BlogPosting",
       "headline": "Your Blog Post Title",
       "description": "Your blog post description",
       "datePublished": "YYYY-MM-DD",
       "author": {
         "@type": "Person",
         "name": "Your Name"
       }
     }
     </script>
   ```

6. **Optimize Images:**
   - Compress images to reduce file size and improve page load speed.
   - Use descriptive filenames and alt text for images to enhance accessibility and SEO.
   - Consider lazy loading images to prioritize content loading and improve user experience.

7. **Mobile-Friendly Design:**
   - Ensure that the template is responsive and mobile-friendly to provide a seamless user experience across devices.
   - Test the template on various screen sizes and devices to verify responsiveness and functionality.
